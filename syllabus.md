# DATA 3210 - Business Analytics

## Course Information
- **Course Code**: DATA3210
- **Course Title**: Business Analytics
- **Credit Hours**: 3 credits
- **Office Hours**: In class, or by appointment made in class

## Faculty Contact Information
- **Name**: Illya Mowerman, Ph.D.
- **Email**: [imowerman@fairfield.edu](mailto:imowerman@fairfield.edu)

## Course Description
This course introduces basic skills necessary for business analytics such as data analysis and preparation, probability and statistical modeling, data-driven decision making, and persuasion/storytelling with data.

## Learning Objectives
- To provide an understanding of data science and analytics, including how they are used and communicated in business organizations.
- To review data analysis and statistics, with a focus on visual representation of data and developing statistical thinking.
- To teach predictive analytics methods, including regression analysis, supervised and unsupervised learning models.
- To teach prescriptive analytic techniques.

## Required Software
All students are required to use R and R-Studio. R is a statistical programming language, and R Studio is the third-party software user interface for R. They will be used in almost all course assignments. R is freely available under GNP General Public License for various operating systems (including Windows and Mac OS), and RStudio is also a free download. You can download them on your own computer as described below:

1. **Download R**: Visit [https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/)
2. **Download R-Studio**: Visit [https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/)
   - Choose ‘RStudio Desktop Open Source Edition’ for your operating system.

## Course Grading and Assignments
- **Late submissions**: Not accepted. Once the due date has passed, you will not be able to submit. If the school administration contacts the professor regarding your approved absence, a late submission will be accepted.
- **Assignments (90%)**: Nine (9) assignments in total. Some assignments may span several classes. Assignments must be submitted via Blackboard. Emailed assignments will not be graded. Assignments will be available until the due date. After the due date, there will be no option to submit. Assignments 2-9 have the option of being done in pairs. These pairs will be made at the beginning of the semester.
- **Attendance (10%)**: Attendance will be taken every class, unless made optional by the professor. If the school has excused you from attending class, ensure the professor has been notified, and you will be marked present.
- **Extra Credit Assignment (5%)**: At the end of the semester, there will be an extra credit assignment.
- **Total Evaluation**: All evaluations sum to 105%, providing ample room for students to achieve an excellent grade in the class.

## Groups (Pairs)
At the beginning of the semester, groups will be formed (1-2 students). The goal is to allow students to work with another student and leverage each other’s strengths. Groups are not intended to:
- Have students alternate doing the assignments.
- Not doing the assignments.
- Assigning blame for not submitting or poor performance.
If a student decides to work with someone and issues arise, the professor will only intervene by separating the group, and there will likely be no option for joining another group.

## Communication with the Professor (Non-Standard Course Policies)
- Communication is most preferable in person. Questions regarding any assignment must be made in class. Assignment questions will not be answered by email.
- Do not email to explain why you did not attend class. If the school has excused you from attending class, ensure the professor has been notified, and you will be marked present.

## Course Schedule
The course flows in four modules, each six classes in length, with adjustments as needed.

## Coding and The Use of AI Tools
The use of AI tools is optional and encouraged for coding. In today’s work environment, the use of AI tools is becoming more mainstream and, at many firms, is a requirement, implicitly or explicitly. However, relying completely (100%) on AI tools for analytics-related work and computer programming is not feasible yet. One must check the output and results.

As applicable to the module, examples of how to effectively use AI tools will be demonstrated in class. It is crucial to learn the syntax used in coding, as AI tools may give answers that are almost correct and need modifications. Keep in mind that almost correct is analogous to incorrect.

## Standard Course Policies
### Academic Honesty
Fairfield University’s primary purpose is the pursuit of academic excellence. All members of the Fairfield University community share responsibility for establishing and maintaining appropriate standards of academic honesty and integrity. This is possible only in an atmosphere where discovery and communication of knowledge are marked by scrupulous, unqualified honesty. In the event of such dishonesty, professors are to award a grade of zero for the project, paper, or examination in question, and may record an F for the course itself. For extra credit, if you go to the assignment on Google Classroom called "extra credit" and place a private comment with the phrase "academic honesty" before the end of the second week of classes this semester (before the end of the first month of the calendar year), you will get one extra credit point. Late submissions will not count.

### Students with Disabilities
Fairfield University is committed to providing qualified students with disabilities an equal opportunity to access the benefits, rights, and privileges of its services, programs, and activities in an accessible setting. In compliance with Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, the Americans with Disabilities Act, and Connecticut State laws, reasonable accommodations are provided to qualified students to reduce the impact of disabilities on academic functioning or upon other major life activities.

### Mental Health
Fairfield University provides mental health services to support the academic and personal success and well-being of students. Counseling & Psychological Services offers free, confidential psychological services to help students manage personal challenges that may interfere with their well-being. Fairfield University is committed to advancing the mental health and well-being of its students. If you or someone you know is feeling overwhelmed, depressed, and/or in need of support, services are available.
